# Supervision Agreement

This repository contains a template for a supervision agreement.
A supervision agreement can be used by academic supervisors to clearly state what their M.Sc. and B.Sc. students can expect from them while writing their thesis, and what is in turn expected of the students.

This is explicitly a template that is intended to be heavily modified.
Feel free to adapt this text to fit your needs, add logos, copy it to different templates, or just simply use it as an inspiration when writing your own.
